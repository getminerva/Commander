# WHERE DID I LEAVE OFF

# TODO
+ Add RadioHead / whatever comm library directly to the Commander?
	- Could/would be useful...but probably not. Multiple transceivers would probably be difficult to manage
+ Implement cmd/msg structs and parsing.
+ Make utility functions amorphous? a single (maybe, maybe not) toString() function that handles different data types.

# WORKLOG

./
+ Added this TODO
+ Stable. It's a dud, but mostly stable.
